# encounter

**Version 4.11.0**

A script that manages a combat encounter for tabletop rpgs.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.9.1 or higher
* Recommended to have a bestiary file. Must be named "bestiary" with no file extension. An example bestiary file with its associated formatting is included on the encounter GitHub page.
  * If no bestiary file is found the program will still work, but only with a very limited selection of generic characters.
